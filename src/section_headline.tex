Thony is a motivated developer with a passion for automation and efficient solutions. Through his extensive experience in scale-ups, he has grown a skill set to move fast and drive changes that brings the most value when it is needed. His interest in early-stage development has been critical in his roles as a senior engineer and tech lead balancing stakeholder management and best practice implementations. His contributions to any project aside from development are a team member with a deep sense of responsibility, excellent communication, and a passion for solving problems.

His experience within the MedTech industry, where systems are centered around reliable deliveries and robust systems, has pruned a mindset for safe and secure data management, development, and deployments. That mindset ensures all his deliveries are crafted with care and designed to last.
