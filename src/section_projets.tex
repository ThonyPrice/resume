	{Home Operations Cluster}{2022 - Now}
    { \github{ThonyPrice/home-ops} }
    {
        To create a playground for learning more about Cloud and Infrastructure Thony runs a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on old hardware at home.
        The deployments include home automation tasks, a media server, and a few websites, monitoring, logging, etc. This has provided multiple challenges for learning and practicing networking, routing, cluster management, security, secret management, and automation.

	{Automated System Configuration}{2022 - Now}
	{\github{ThonyPrice/nix-config}}
    {
        Being very passionate about development tools and customization Thony contentiously spend time perfecting system configuration such as Emacs, window managers and vim configurations.
        This led him to investigate a structured approach to optimize his tools and environments in a reproducible manner.
        The result is a dotfiles repository which makes it possible to recreate and sync a personalized productivity environment with a few custom terminal commands.
