# Resume - Thony Price

This repository holds my resume.
It's built with LaTeX and exported as an PDF available to download in the /Releases/.

## About

Credit to @darwiin who is the author of the LaTeX template used.

This fork implements the following changes:
- My resume content (of course...),
- Trimming boilerplate files, and
- Implementing GitHub Action to build and publish PDF to a release _when_ a tag is pushed.
